## Who composes the team

Andrea Righi (Matr. n. 15483) and Cristiano Lucian (Matr. n. 15850)

## What is the overall goal of the project

Mobile application of the website project developed during Web and Internet Engineering course of last semester.
Together with Matteo Messmer, we created a fablab management website (http://fablabnetwork.tk): we developed
some functionalities and we already have developed the API. Therefore we would like to implement the React mobile 
version for this system, improving some features.

## What are the functionalities the project should implement

Based on the website already existent, we would like to implement all the old functionalities (visible online or in the attached pdf).
We will improve the booking procedure; we will implement the localization of the current device on the fablabs' map.

## A rough distribution of responsibilities (who will implement what?)

We will divide equally the workload, opening issue on this repo at the beginning for each functionality, updating them with possible bugs and commiting our work frequently.
